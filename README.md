# Analyzing Seasonal and H1N1 Flu Surveys

-Student Names: Nick Kennedy, Tim Cleary, Elijah Jarocki

### **Business and Data Understanding**

In 2009, a virulent h1n1, or swine flu variant began infecting much of the population. It was a virus of concern due it's potential to make people very sick, even more so than tha seasonal flu could. When it became clear that medical efforts were needed, vaccines, both injectable as well as a nasal vaccine containing live, attenuated h1n1 virus were created to minimize risk. However, many of these, especially the more effective (but higher in side-effects) nasal/live vaccine were not widely available across the country. In this report we hope to address the issues concerning vaccination production and vaccination rates.

The Data we used was from the CDC's 2009 National H1N1 Flu Vaccine Survey of nearly 27K respondents. It is entirely comprised of basic medical, behavioral, and demographic information.

### **Conclusion**

Through our findings we've discovered that a relationship with/ reccomendation from one's MD is critical for vaccine-willingness in patients. We also learned that these Dr. Reccomendations are given at a much higher rate to older generations. In the world-changing global pandemic of SARS COVID-19, the world saw that younger people are much more amenaable to receiving vaccines. Thus we propose measures to increase Dr. reccomendations to younger demographics.

### **Going Forward**

For further research we intend to look at the impacts of whether or not the survey takers have health insurance, or if they have contracted the flu in the past.
